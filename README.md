## Project Structure and Primary Design Patterns
Todo
   * Provides for [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
   * Eases long term maintenance
   * Follows the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle


**Additional Note:** \
Where docstrings are used, they should follow the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and reStructuredText (reST) format as defined by the
[PEP 287 standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/).

## Third Party Dependencies
Note: All required packages can be setup and installed in a virtual python environment with
the following command:
```shell script
py -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate.bat && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If these requirements ever change you can easily export the new requirements list using:
```shell script
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Required:**\
These packages are required for this project to run.  Some of these packages have
additional dependencies of their own.
For the full list or required packages see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
